# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for the **IBM Applied Data Science Capstone** on Coursera.  
The objective of this project is to analyze historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data and predict whether the first-stage booster will successfully land after launch.

Successful booster recovery plays a key role in reducing launch costs and improving mission efficiency.
